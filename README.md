# Hyperlocal Weather & Extreme Event Forecasting – Delhi

This project implements a machine learning pipeline for hyperlocal
weather and air pollution forecasting in Delhi.

The system focuses on forecasting temperature, PM2.5, PM10, fog events,
and identifying extreme weather and pollution conditions using historical
meteorological and air quality data.

## Key Features
- Hyperlocal weather forecasting for Delhi
- PM2.5 and PM10 prediction
- Fog detection based on meteorological thresholds
- Extreme pollution and weather event classification
- Machine learning–based approach

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for dashboard)

## Project Structure
- `src/` – Model training and data processing scripts
- `data/` – Dataset (ignored in GitHub)
- `models/` – Trained models (ignored in GitHub)

## Note
Large datasets and trained model files are excluded using `.gitignore`
to keep the repository lightweight and reproducible.
